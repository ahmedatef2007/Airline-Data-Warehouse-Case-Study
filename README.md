## Business Processes:

### 1. Passenger Registration and Profile Creation:
- Passengers register and provide personal information.
- Passenger profiles are created with details such as status, club membership type, mileage tier, and membership status.

### 2. Flight Reservation:
- Passengers make flight reservations through various booking channels.
- Each reservation includes details like confirmation number, ticket number, departure airport, arrival airport, scheduled departure date, and flight type.

### 3. Flight Activity Tracking:
- Tracking of flight activities involves recording data related to each flight segment.
- This includes information such as aircraft details, departure, and arrival airport keys, scheduled and actual departure and arrival dates and times, fare price, taxes, luggage, and any upgrades.

### 4. Customer Care Interaction:
- Customers interact with customer service agents for problem resolution and feedback.
- Interactions are logged with details like interaction type, problem severity, flight type, date, time, and customer information.

### 5. Frequent Flyer Program:
- Members earn and redeem frequent flyer miles based on flight activities.
- Frequent flyer facts capture member details, flight information, miles earned and redeemed, and any upgrades.

### 6. Fare Basis and Payment:
- Fare basis details are recorded, including fare type, code, and promotional status.

## Why we Choose This Model
We chose this data model design because it aligns with the Kimball method, which emphasizes simplicity, flexibility, and usability in data warehousing projects. Our approach involved breaking down the data into separate tables, each focusing on a specific aspect of the business processes involved in airline operations.

1. Simplicity: By breaking down the data into separate tables for each business process, we ensure simplicity in data management and querying. Each table represents a distinct entity or aspect of the business, making it easier to understand and work with the data.

2. Flexibility: The modular design of our data model allows for easy modification and expansion as business requirements evolve. New tables can be added to accommodate additional business processes or data sources without disrupting existing structures.

3. Focus on Business Processes: Each table in our data model represents a specific business process or entity relevant to airline operations. For example, we have tables for passenger information, flight details, reservations, customer care interactions, and frequent flyer programs.

## Business Questions
- What flights the companyâ€™s frequent flyers mostly take?
- Analyze fare basis paid by frequent flyers.
- Calculate frequency of upgrades by frequent flyers' Silver Club.
- Calculate frequency of upgrades by frequent flyers 'Gold Club'.
- Responses to special fare promotions by frequent flyers.
- The portion of passengers in the different club memberships.
- Most departured from.
- Most arrived airport.
- Number of Resolved Complaints.
- Total number of interactions per severity level.
- Number of interactions by interaction type and channel.
- What are the preferred booking channels for reservations?
- Which flights are preferred by frequent flyers?
- How often do frequent flyers upgrade their class?
- How do frequent flyers earn and redeem their miles?
- What is the total net price earned from reservations for each quarter of a specific year?

## Assumptions
1. To be a frequent flyer you must exceed 100,000 miles and travel 5 times per year.
2. Feedback from a customer is divided into 2 categories (inquiry or complaint) which may happen before, within, or after the trip, and we keep track of the status which may be resolved, pending, or escalated.
3. Passengers can upgrade their class.
4. Passengers can redeem their points for various rewards such as free flights, cash back rewards, seat upgrades, gift cards, and free hotel status.
